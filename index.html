        <h1>Love, Life and Rock & Roll</h1>

        <p>Since I first got your playlists I've been trying to come up with the perfect set of tunes for you. As the list grew too big (in my mind) and founded hard to mix tunes with different vibes I've set myself to a harder problem, a conceptual album tha contains every subject and mood that exists</p>
        <p>As you can probably imagine, having such an important task paralize me and nothing got done for a long time. As I decided to stop being an idiot and just do it knowinly that nothing is gonna be perfect and actually doing it was probably the important point things got done pretty quickly. Please keep in mind that even when I relate with some of the songs not everything they say is meant literal. Some of them are rock stars, I'm not.</p>
        <p>Before you get to the links, please apreciate this <b>Diego</b> in the fire for good fortune and enjoyment. All of these are work in progress but wanted to get it out anyway</p>

        <h2>Love</h2>
        <p>May be that I find interesting how they express it, the tunes are cool or I just happen to like the vibe. Some of them, I resonate specially on how I feel about you or us and some of them, I suppose, are meant to just allow you to search into your own feelings and give them your own meaning. I hope that overall make you feel good and loved because I love you with all my hearth.</p>

        <h2>Life</h2>
        <p>Tried to compile songs that talk in some meaningful, profound or intersting way about topics that I like or resonate with me in some way. As I hope to share the rest of my life with you, I hope you find them interesting too.</p>
